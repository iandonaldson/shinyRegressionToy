shinyRegressionToy
==================

This is a demonstration of a shiny app.

The user can create a set of X and Y values by specifying the mean and stdev for X and the slope and intercept 
coefficients that relate X to Y.

The data are plotted and a linear regression model is made by R's lm function.

The plot and model summary can be viewed in the model tab.  Other data (such as histograms of X and Y values and the 
complete set of X,Y values) can be viewed in other tabs.
